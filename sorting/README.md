# Sorting algorithms
In this session, we will practice Python basics by implementing all kinds of 
sorting algorithms. So given an array, our objective will be to sort that array.

If you feel confident with some exercises, you are free to skip them, 
however if you haven't used Python before, doing them is advised.

Today's problems (sorted by order of difficulty):
1. `builtin_sort_list`
2. `bubble_sort`
3. `insertion_sort`
4. `selection_sort`
5. `merge_sort`
6. `quick_sort`
7. `heap_sort`
